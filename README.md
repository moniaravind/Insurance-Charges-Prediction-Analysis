In this project, I performed a thorough analysis of an insurance dataset to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models for insurance charges.

Data Preprocessing and Analysis:
Loaded the dataset using the Pandas library, containing information about policyholders.
Explored the dataset's dimensions, revealing 1338 records and 7 attributes.
Checked for missing values, ensuring data integrity.
Utilized summary statistics and visualizations to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data.
Identified and removed duplicate entries to maintain data accuracy.

Data Visualization:
Employed Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create visual representations of key attributes, such as gender, smoking status, and region distribution.
Visualized the correlation between attributes using a heatmap to uncover potential relationships.

Data Transformation and Encoding:
Applied Label Encoding to convert categorical variables like 'sex', 'smoker', and 'region' into numerical format for model compatibility.

Machine Learning Modeling:
Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y), including attributes like age, sex, BMI, children, smoking status, and region.
Utilized train-test splitting for model evaluation, allocating 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing.
Standardized the feature set using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity in scale.

Linear Regression Model:
Trained a Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges based on the standardized features.
Evaluated model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Support Vector Regression (SVR):
Implemented Support Vector Regression, a powerful regression technique suitable for non-linear relationships.
Conducted hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search to identify the optimal model configuration.
Assessed model performance using MAE and RMSE metrics.

Predicting Insurance Charges for New Customers:
Calculated the average values of the dataset's attributes and created a numpy array to represent a new customer.
Predicted the insurance charges for the new customer using the trained SVR model.

Insights and Findings:
Determined the average values for each attribute in the dataset, providing valuable insights into the policyholder demographics.
Successfully predicted insurance charges for a hypothetical new customer, showcasing the model's practical applicability.

Overall, this project demonstrated proficiency in data analysis, preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning modeling, culminating in the development of a robust predictive model for insuranceÂ charges.
